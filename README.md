# Kostka

### Your portable Rubik's Cube

![Cube of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hejsztynx/kostka/main/readme/cube.gif)

##### A fast and lightweight Rubikâ€™s Cube simulator written in Rust, featuring smooth real-time rendering and intuitive controls.

## Features âœ¨

- `Pixels + winit rendering` *â€“ lightweight, fast, and perfect for pixel-based graphics.* [pixels crate.io page](https://crates.io/crates/pixels)

- `Manual 2D projection` â€“ all cube transformations and perspective math are done by hand, no external 3D engine.

- `Intuitive key mappings` â€“ *speedcube-ready* controls designed to feel natural for cubers and provide highest mobility. Nothing better than relearning all of your algorithms on the keyboard all over again!

- `Smooth performance` â€“ Fluid experience with **120 FPS**.

- `Timer functionality` â€“ measure your solve times directly in the app.

- `Custom settings` - Adjust performance and cube speed settings

## Presets

With some command-line parameters, you can adjust some of the application's attributes such as:

- rendered resolution `--res` (directly affects performance)
- speed at which the cube rotates `--rs`
- speed at which layers are rotating during a move `--ms`

There are available 3 presets (*low*, *medium*, *high*) for each setting.

#### Example

```
kostka --res medium --ms high --rs low
```

The *medium* presets are set by default if no flags specified.

For further info use the `--help` option.

## Controls ðŸŽ®

Key mappings are designed to resemble real cube rotations as much as possible. Experiment a bit â€” after a few tries it becomes second nature.

Timer can be switched on and off with the `2` key. You can only start the timer after resetting the game and scrambling the cube with the `1` key.

## Installing ðŸ”§

Make sure that *cargo bin* directory is added to system's `PATH`

```
cargo install kostka
kostka
```

*Requires Rust installed (latest stable recommended).*
